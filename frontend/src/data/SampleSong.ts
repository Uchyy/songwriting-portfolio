    lyrics: `you
(I've gone insane) Mad
(I can’t escape) Mad
(You've driven me) Mad over you
VERSE 2
Every night, you haunt my dreams
Nothing's ever what it seems
I lose myself inside your eyes
Can't tell the truth from the lies
It's a rush I can't deny
You're my poison, my supply
I know I'm playing with a flame
But I'd do it all again
HOOK 
I'm Craving, Ravenous
A hunger I can't undo - hazardous
Zigzaging, lost control 
You’ve invaded my heart and my soul
(I think, I think)
CHORUS
I think 
I've gone 
Mad! Mad!! 
Mad over you
HOOK 
I'm Craving, Ravenous
A hunger I can't undo - hazardous
Zigzaging, lost control 
You’ve invaded my heart and my soul
(I think, I think)
CHORUS
I think 
I've gone 
I think 
I've gone 
Mad! Mad!! 
Mad over you
(I've gone insane) Mad
(I can’t escape) Mad
(You've driven me) Mad over you
I think 
I've gone 
Mad! Mad!! 
Mad over you`,

    lyrics: `Cold cold heart
Cold cold bed
Alone in a dark room
Waiting for you
Empty chair
Broken heart
When he comes in
Smelling like her cheap perfume

[INSTRUMENTAL]

A rotten smell
Poisoned air
I can barely breathe in
Suffocating 
Tainted shirt
With lipstick marks
Red is a colour 
And I'm seeing it

[INSTRUMENTAL]

CHORUS
What was love is now a lie
What was gold has lost its shine
What's a flower without it's bloom?
What's left of us but cheap perfume?


VERSE 3:
Clean white shirt
Stained beneath 
Still stinking of her cheap perfume
White to flames
Still remains
Can see the red
Beneath the amber flame

[INSTRUMENTAL]

Fists are balled
Voices raised
But neither of us can hear a thing


CHORUS
What was love is now a lie
What was gold has lost its shine
What's a flower without it's bloom?
What's left of us but cheap perfume?


What was love is now a lie
What was gold has lost its shine
What's a flower without it's bloom?
What's left of us but cheap perfume?

[INSTRUMENTAL]


Bridge:
(in almost a hushed whisper)
Wash it clean
Burn it down
Bury the ashes underground
The wall is stained
With the truth
What remains of me and you?

Wash it clean
Burn it down
Bury the ashes underground
The wall is stained
With the truth
What remains of me and you?

What was love is now a lie
What was gold has lost its shine

    lyrics: `AGAIN


There’s no one to hold me
No one to catch my fall
I'm floating in this void,
An abyss where echoes call.
I don’t know if can feel again
For your touch has left me wanting more

I don’t know if can ever
Ever feel again
I don’t know if can ever
Ever feel again

I’m looking all o’er
Did anyone find my love?
Came like a robber
Made away with my heart
Your love was my guiding star,
Now darkness is all that I can see.
I don’t know if I will ever
Ever love again


Again! Again!! Again!!!
Come and make me feel again


Standing at a crossroad
Not knowing what path to walk
Voices overload
Even gravity fights my fall
Left or right, or I’m stuck where I am
There is no light at the end of this

I don’t know if can ever
Ever feel again
I don’t know if can ever
Ever feel again


Again! Again!! Again!!!
Come and make me feel again
Again! Again!! Again!!!
Come and make me love again



I don’t think that I can breathe (Again)
Without you I lose my feet
Close to you, I stand so tall
Someone please catch my fall

Chorus:
Again! Again!! Again!!!
Come and make me feel again
Again! Again!! Again!!!
Come and make me love again
Again! Again!! Again!!!
Come and make me breathe again
